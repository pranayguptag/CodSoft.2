Completed Task 2: "IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION" for CodSoft Internship!
"I'm excited to share my second project on iris flower classification. I completed this project during my internship at CodSoft
"I built a machine learning model in Python to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. My model achieved an accuracy of 95%, which is significantly higher than the baseline accuracy of 33.33%. I used the following features to train my model: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. I also explored the data to identify any interesting patterns. For example, I found that Setosa flowers have the smallest sepals and petals, while Virginica flowers have the largest sepals and petals. I'm excited to share my findings with the community and to continue learning about machine learning."
Here are some additional details that you can include in the caption:
1.The dataset used for this project is the Iris flower dataset, which is available on Kaggle
2.The machine learning algorithm used for this project is a logistic regression classifier.
3.This project was inspired by the work of other data scientists who have used machine learning to classify iris flowers.
